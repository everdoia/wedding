            <h1>Our Story</h1>
          </div>

          
          <p>Maggie moved to the Monterey Peninsula in 2006 after graduating from Gettysburg College, for two reasons: to be in the land of John Steinbeck and to get as far away from the East Coast as possible (what can I say, the girl loves adventure!). She joined an AmeriCorps program, drove across the country with her good friend Kris, moved into an apartment with two other girls — one from Oregon, and one from Washington — and her new life had begun!
            <br><br>

            Evan grew up in the San Francisco Bay area and was attending CSU Monterey Bay. After enduring a few debaucl-ey housing situations, he responded to an advertisement on Craigslist for an apartment already occupied by two AmeriCorps members, who were looking for a third roommate. Lo and behold, these two AmeriCorps members (Michele and Jeremy) were in the same program as Maggie! They were, and still are, great friends and will be representing in the wedding party!<br><br>

              After being introduced by Michele, Maggie and Evan hit it off and the rest is history!</p>

          <h3>Bridesmaid: Caitlin Merritt</h3>

          <h3>Bridesmaid: Stephanie Ried</h3>

          <p>The wedding and reception will be held at Memory Gardens in Monterey, CA, which is the most visited garden in Monterey State Historic Park.  Graceful stucco archways, framed by multi-colored roses and other flowers, make this a photographer's favorite.  Stucco walls of the Pacific House and garden isolate this garden from the city, creating quiet and solitude. Located at the back of the Pacific House Museum at Custom House Plaza, Memory Gardens is within walking distance of downtown Monterey, the beach, Fisherman's Wharf, and several bars and restaurants. <br><br> </p> <img src="http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/575/images/memory%20garden%20(pacific%20house).jpg" width="200" height="200" alt=""><img src=" img/examples/memory-garden.jpg" width="401" height="400" alt="">

          <h2>Airports</h2>
          <p>You have two options: 1. San Jose International Airport (KSJC) or Monterey Regional Airport (KMRY).</p>
         
          <p>San Jose Airport is about an hour and a half's drive away from Monterey, but is usually the cheaper option.

            Monterey Airport, although only a 15 minute drive from downtown, can sometimes be more expensive.

            We are in the process of negotiating bulk flight prices with airlines. Check back here as the wedding date approaches for more details! 

            Regardless of what airport you choose, please let us know in advance, so we are able to arrange for transportation if you do not plan on renting a car.</p>

          <hr class="bs-docs-separator">


          <h2>Driving <small>From the Airport</small></h2>

          
          

          <h4>Highway 17 (From SJC Airport)</h4>
          <p>This is a really windy road with beautiful views, but not for the faint of heart. Take this road in a small car only. It is the fastest way to get to Monterey from San Jose Airport . . .</p>
         

          <h4>Highway 101 to Highway 1 (From SJC Airport) </h4>
          
          <p>This route is just as good and much more "highway." You can take this directly into Monterey and ride along Highway 1, overlooking the ocean (Maggie's commute for a few years!).</p>

          <h4>Highway 68 (From MRY Airport)</h4>
          <p>This is a short ride and a beautiful drive from the airport to downtown Monterey.</p>

          <hr class="bs-docs-separator">

          <h2>Public Trolley <small>Free</small></h2>
          <p>If you stay in Monterey, there is a free trolley that runs throughout most of Monterey and adjoining cities for free!  The trolley runs every 15 minutes. You can find out more information on the MST website here: <a href="http://www.monterey.org/Portals/1/parking/pdfs/trolleymapcolor.pdf">Monterey Trolley</a> </p>

                <h2>17 Mile Drive <small> Some of our favorite views</small></h2><p>17 Mile Drive is a beautiful, scenic drive that overlooks the coastline and winds between million dollar homes and the Pebble Beach golf course. The Lone Cypress tree, a Monterey landmark, is really cool around dusk. It does cost to enter the drive, but the fee ($9.75) can be reimbursed if you dine at one of the Pebble Beach resort restaurants. If you are a golfer, you have to see the greens here!</p>

                <h2>Point Lobos State Reserve<small> </small></h2><p>The California coast is so beautiful and rugged here, and the Monterey cypress grove juxtaposed against the rocky coast and the vibrant blue ocean is equally stunning. This park is a favorite of Maggie and Evan's, as they spent a lot of time here when they lived on the peninsula. Definitely bring a camera, water, a hat, and some good walking shoes, because you'll be out there in the sun a long time walking the (well-marked, generally easy, a couple handicap accessible) trails admiring the beautiful coastal views. <br><br><a href="http://www.pointlobos.org/">Point Lobos</a> </p>

Evan once swam in the Outer Bay Tank as part of his summer job!<br><h4>Pro tip:</h4> Buy your tickets from your hotel, and get the tickets that are good for two days (so you can go the afternoon you arrive and again the next morning). The tickets are the same price as the regular tickets but give you much greater flexibility, especially if you have kids and will need to take a break in touring. Take time to visit one of the best aquariums in the United States!  <br><br><a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/">Monterey Bay Aquarium</a> </p>
                <h2>Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk</h2><p>Old-fashioned carnival games and snack booths can be found throughout the 24-acre (9.7 ha) park. It is located at 400 Beach Street in Santa Cruz, south of the Ocean Street exit of California State Route 1, which is the southern terminus of California State Route 17. It has won the Best Seaside Amusement Park Award from Amusement Today in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Although there is no admission and the beach is public, parking is charged a fee when the rides are open. Season or day passes can be purchased or tickets for one dollar; rides take 3 to 5 tickets each.</p><a href="http://www.beachboardwalk.com/">Beach Boardwalk </a>
